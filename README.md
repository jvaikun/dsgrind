# Deep Space Grind: Credits Rule Everything Around Me
Top down Diablo-like shooter, heavily inspired by the mapping endgame of Path of Exile.  
Fire up the game, play a mission, make some kind of progress each time. Whether doing one mission, a few missions, or binging for hours, time should feel well spent.  
Also a small amount of inspiration from the secret mission objectives from TIE Fighter, where you work for the Emperor’s inner circle in addition to the Imperial Navy.  
The idea is to run multiple hustles by juggling various faction jobs, milking them for profit while trying not to get caught, sort of like Han Solo's first scene in The Force Awakens, where he’s in the middle of 3 to 4 side hustles blowing up in his face.  
Aesthetic: Raptor, Tyrian, Raiden  
Tone: Should not take itself seriously. Idiot dirtbag space hicks, ala Starcraft. Incredible future tech manned by jagoffs who have no business handling it.  
Sound: Chunky and thumping like an old arcade cabinet. Dirty, filthy synth farts.
